Whe approaching a new program ask yourself this:

    Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
    What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
    Whatâ€™s the desired output?
    Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?


Thinking like a programmer:
    Base concepts:
    When creating algoriths:

        Creating Variables:
            -name
            -initial value
            -type

        Outputting:
            -message

        Inputting:
            -variable
            -message

        While loop:
            -sentry
            -start
            -stop
            -change
